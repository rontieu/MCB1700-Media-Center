# MCB1700-Media-Center

A media center was built onto a MCB1700 board which contained an ARM Cortex-M3 processor in C.
From the main menu of this board, it was possible using the joystick in and out of the following options.

- **Photo Gallery**
- **Music Player**
- **Snake**

**Photo Gallery**: Preloaded images could be chosen from a list and viewed in the photo viewer. Different images could be viewed through the use of the joystick.

**Music Player**: USB Audio Connection would be set up from the computer so the board would be treated as if it was a USB speaker device.
 It was possible to lower or raise the volume of the speakers based on the position of the potentiometer.
 
 **Snake**: An implementation of the classic game snake was implemented onto the board using the joystick as the controller. The options to include or exclude borders when playing this game were included.
